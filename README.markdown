# Microdata Utilities

A set of XSLT utilities for marking up common data types using a vocabulary that Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! can all understand. 

The utilities are bundled with Scaffolds (https://github.com/brendo/scaffolds) files for quick and easy creation of related Symphony sections. 

At present there is a single XSLT file - things.xsl (http://www.schema.org/Thing).
